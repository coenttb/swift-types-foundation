# swift-types-foundation: Type-Safe Foundation for Swift

`swift-types-foundation` is a Swift library that bundles essential type-safe packages for domain modeling and data handling. It provides a single dependency for libraries that need to declare strongly-typed models, such as `swift-html-types` and similar type-focused packages.

## Included Libraries

This foundation consolidates type-safe packages that are commonly used for domain modeling:

### **Core Type-Safe Models**

- **[EmailAddress](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-emailaddress-type)** - Domain-accurate and type-safe email address handling that adheres to web standards
- **[Domain](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-domain-type)** - Type-safe domain model consistent with web standards for reliable domain handling

### **Date & Time Types**

- **[DateParsing](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-date-parsing)** - Comprehensive date parsing for RFC 2822, RFC 5322, and Unix epoch timestamps with robust error handling
- **[UnixEpochParsing](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-date-parsing)** - Unix epoch timestamp parsing utilities
- **[FoundationExtensions](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-foundation-extensions)** - Powerful extensions for date manipulation, validation, and formatting with intuitive operations like `date + 1.day`

### **URL & Form Types**

- **[URLRouting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-url-routing)** - Point-Free's powerful URL routing library for type-safe navigation
- **[URLRoutingTranslating](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-url-routing-translating)** - Internationalization support for routing with multi-language URL patterns
- **[URLFormCoding](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-url-form-coding)** - Type-safe URL form encoding and decoding

### **Language & Localization Types**

- **[Translating](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-translating)** - Comprehensive translation and localization framework

### **Utilities & Infrastructure**

- **[Builders](https://github.com/coenttb/swift-builders)** - Result builders for creating collections and content with declarative, SwiftUI-like syntax
- **[Dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies)** - SwiftUI Environment-inspired dependency management for controllable and testable applications
- **[CasePaths](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-case-paths)** - Key path-like functionality for enum cases
- **[IssueReporting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/xctest-dynamic-overlay)** - Runtime issue reporting and debugging utilities

## Usage

Instead of importing multiple individual packages:

```swift
import EmailAddress
import Domain
import DateParsing
import URLRouting
import Translating
import Builders
// ... and many more
```

Simply import the foundation:

```swift
import TypesFoundation

// All type-safe functionality is now available:
let email = try EmailAddress("user@example.com")
let domain = try Domain("example.com")
let date = Date.now + 1.day
let route = URLRoute<MyRoute>()
```

## Installation

To use **swift-types-foundation** in your project, add it to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/coenttb/swift-types-foundation.git", from: "0.0.1")
]
```

Then add it to your target dependencies:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "TypesFoundation", package: "swift-types-foundation")
    ]
)
```
